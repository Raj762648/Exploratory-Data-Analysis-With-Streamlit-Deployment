## Project Overview
This project is a Streamlit application for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and species prediction of the Iris dataset.

### Users can:
- Explore the Iris dataset with interactive plots.

- Perform feature-wise EDA with histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.

- Predict the species of an iris flower using a Logistics regression model.

- View the image of the predicted species alongside prediction probabilities.

### Features:

- ✅ Interactive EDA dashboard

- ✅ Histogram, Boxplot, and Scatterplot visualizations

- ✅ Train/Test split and preprocessing included

- ✅ Species prediction with input sliders

- ✅ Prediction probabilities displayed as a bar chart

- ✅ Predicted species image displayed

- ✅ Fully contained in a Streamlit web app
